## **_Milestone Project 3 - Data Centric Development_**

## **Project Description**
This project is a makeup review website, developed with the purpose of providing real, honest and authentic reviews on makeup products. It allows users to add, edit and delete their own content. The makeup industry has grown exponentially over the last decade, there is a vast amount of products to choose from and a growing number of sites to purchase from. Makeup is an art, it provides a way for people to express themselves. With the growth of influencers, the idea of trustworthy reviews has become an issue in mainstream society. The people promoting these products have a lot to gain from the results of pushing product sales. With this in mind, I decided to develop a review site that allows everyday users to add their opinion on products, and also see product reviews left by other users. The user can then add products to their favourites, which is a list of products the user wants to buy. The inspiration for this project was from personal experience. I am always on the hunt for good makeup products to buy, but it can be so easy to get lost in the sea of information, and false advertising. It's difficult to trust reviews you see on Instagram, or on sites where they are selling these products. This site acts as a sort of makeup forum, with the hope of providing a tips and tricks section, or makeup tutorials section in the future and hopefully providing a platform by which users can connect with each other through their love for makeup.

### **_Business Objectives_**

- Allow users to create a profile and build a 'to buy' list of all their favourite products.
- Help users to find the products they are looking for.

### **_Customer Objectives_**
- To establish the purpose of the website immediately.
- To easily navigate the website.
- To be able to quickly search for the products they are looking for.

- To have the ability to remove products from the favourites list.

## **UX**
This website was designed for makeup lovers who are looking for honest product reviews, from everyday makeup users. The aim of the website is to allow users to identify, browse and comment on the products they like  or dislike and if they are worth purchasing. The design of this website is fun and inviting, with the use of vivid imagery and a bright and vibrant colour palette. The idea is to to create a reliable review platform for users, and encourage users to want to sign up, create content, and express their honest opinions on products. It is user-friendly, and easy to navigate with clear calls to action.

### **_Strategy Plane_**
- The aim of this project was to develop a makeup review website that provides honest real reviews on makeup products, from everyday users real life experience using the products. The website is vibrant, energetic, fun, inviting, and easy to navigate.
- This website was designed with a focus on user experience and user needs, with the aim of encouraging users to join and create content. With this in mind, I made the decision to include pre-populated products, for an easier user experience. A lot of information would need to be sourced to add a product, which might be discouraging to users when adding content to the site. It is designed so only admin users can add/edit products, and users can add reviews to the products, and edit and delete these from their profile. 
- I have also included a user feedback modal, so that users can communicate with admin on suggested products to add to the site, or provide feedback on site improvements. These feedback comments can then be seen by admin, in the user feedback section on the admin profile, and deleted as necessary.
- This project should be a go to for users when researching makeup products. There are so many makeup product websites and blogs, it is hard to distinguish between them, so I wanted this project to provide a more interactive, and enjoyable way of experiencing this type of website.


### **_Scope Plane_**
- The priority for this project was to create a database of popular user products available on the market, and allow users to create, edit, and delete reviews for these products, while also having access to view other user reviews.
- It was extremely important that the site’s purpose was immediately evident, and that it was fun, and attractive to users. It needed to be vibrant with a clear layout, and easy to use navigation.
- Given my timeframe and skills, my focus was on ensuring that users had control of their own content, to provide a profile where this content could be accessed together, and to provide as many benefits to the user as possible.
- I decided to pre-populate the site's products, and product information, for ease of use, while also providing a means of communication between admin and users. This feedback functionality is so that users can be more involved in content creation, and site improvements.This would allow the Admin team to keep track of areas for improvement, and really deliver the content that the user is looking for.
- The site needed to be easy to use, so it was necessary to include search bars on the homepage, products page and product information pages. I want to ensure that the user can search by product name, brand or category name. This would allow the user to navigate to different items with ease, while also having the navigation bar menu displayed at all times, if they wish to navigate to the homepage, profile, sign out or login and category pages.
- The products page contains a list of products, depending on the item searched or category chosen. Each product shows the user the average reviews, and also the number of reviews for each product, which acts as a link to that product’s reviews. Also included is a button ‘More Info’, that allows the user to navigate to further information, and reviews on that specific product.
- The use of vivid images, and minimal text on the category and product pages, was done so that the user isn't overwhelmed with information, but has the option to get more information about a specific product if they want. The product info page is where they can see product reviews, add a review, or delete a review they've added.The product information shows a limit of 5 reviews for each product, but there is a ‘More Reviews’ button located underneath, to take the user to all the product reviews for that specific item.
- To make navigation easy for the user on the reviews page, I have provided a button that brings the user back to the product information, of that specific item.
- It was also essential that users could create a list of favourite products, and have the ability to add and remove these products whenever they wished to do so. I've included favorite buttons on each product and product information page, that immediately indicates to the user whether the product has been added to this list or not. This is done by using a heart icon, that toggles from outlined to full color, depending on whether the product is in the user's favorites list.
- The user profile welcomes the user with a visual greeting on signing in, and includes an accordion list of their favourite products, a button for leaving feedback comments, the reviews they have created, and a button to delete their account if necessary.
- The admin profile contains a different layout, showing an accordion menu with management items, such as all reviews with the ability to delete these, all users with the ability to delete a user account, user feedback with the ability to delete comments and adding, editing, products and categories for the site.
- Along with this, I wanted the site to be accessible to all, but with extra features/benefits for registered users. The products and reviews can be seen and accessed by everyone who visits the site, but only registered users can add reviews and add their favourite products.


### **_Structure Plane_**
- The structure of this website was designed to be easy to navigate and user-friendly. The navigation bar is visible on every page, and includes different links depending on whether a user is logged in, a guest user or the admin user. It is a vibrant, fun and inviting site, using vivid images and a bright colour scheme, designed to capture the attention and pique the interest of the user.
- The homepage is simple and straightforward, with a bright full-screen background image, and a jumbotron with minimal text that states the website's purpose.A search bar and two call to action buttons, 'Register' and 'Sign In', are also included to encourage the user to create an account. These button are only visible if the user is not logged in. The navigation bar includes a dropdown menu of product category groups, that takes the user to a list of product categories within that group. These are designed using card layout, with a top image, and the product category underneath with a search icon. This will lead the user to the products within the specific category. Minimal text is used here so as not to overload the user with information.
- The products page is designed in a similar layout, using a card structure, with product images and a card with basic product information. The product card includes name, brand, average rating, number of reviews, price and number of shades that are available. It also has a heart icon available to registered users, which will add or remove a product from the user favourites list. It also contains a button 'More Info', that will lead the user to more in-depth information on the specific product.
- The product information page is a card layout, with product image, and product information which includes product name, brand, description, price, average rating and shades available. It also has a heart icon available to registered users, which will add or remove a product from the user favourites list. A button to add a review is available to registered users, and the most recent 5 reviews for that product are shown in card layout, below the product card. At the bottom of the page, under the most recent reviews, is another button, 'More Reviews', which leads the user to the remaining reviews for this product.
- Both the products page and the product information page have a search bar at the top, to allow users to search for different products, by product name, category or brand.
- The reviews page is a card layout, displaying all reviews related to that specific product. Reviews contain a title, star rating, review, user who the review was added by, and the date it was created. This page also contains a button, that will bring the user back to the product information page of the related product.
- The register and login pages can be accessed from the home page, and the navigation bar. It is a basic form which includes fields, username, email and password for signing up and username and password for signing in. These pages also contain links to either page, if the user is on the incorrect one.
- When users register, they have a profile which can be accessed by the navigation bar once they logged in. This page includes a header with the users' names, a list of their favourite products, a button to submit user feedback to admin through a modal, and below this is a list of the reviews the user has created, and a button to delete their account.
- All user functionality, i.e adding and editing content, is done through the use of modal popups, and buttons to delete items. A sweetalert popup appears when the delete buttons are clicked, to confirm any data deletes made on the site.
- The admin user has a slightly different layout on the profile page, which consists of an accordion menu, which allows them to access a list of all users, a list of all reviews, a list of all feedback. These links direct the user to the relevant pages, and gives the admin user the ability to delete any of these list items from the database. It also includes a manage button, to allow the admin user to add, edit or delete a product or category.
- Guest users can view the categories page, products page, product info page, and reviews page, but they cannot access any functionality, such as adding, editing, or deleting reviews.
- Flash messages are used to alert the user when any action has been taken, and are displayed at the top of the page. They are programmed to dropdown and timeout after a few seconds.


**Here is the site layout for this project:**

![Site Layout](static/images/site_layout.jpg "Site Map")

### **Database Architecture**
The database for this project was created using MongoDb. It consists of 5 collections: 
- Categories - stores the category name and category group
- Products - stores the product name, brand, category name, description, price, number of shades, image url, url link to where to purchase
- Reviews - stores the product id, review title, rating, review content, username who created the review and the date it was created
- Users - stores the username, email, password and an array of favourite products(product ids)
- User Feedback - stores the user id, name and comments
- I used the subset pattern for the reviews as each product in the products collection could potentially have numerous reviews so it made sense to split the products and reviews into two separate collections to reduce the size of the product documents.
- The collections were structured as follows:


![Database Schema](static/images/database_schema_design.jpg "Database Collections")


### **_Skeleton Plane_**
This project contains multiple pages, with some pages displaying different elements based on the level of user: Admin user, guest user and registered user. It incorporates CRUD functionality for registered users, and admin users, in a variety of different elements. It also includes delete confirmation popups to ensure the delete functionality is authorised/confirmed by the user or admin user.
This project layout contains the following pages:
- Homepage
- Categories Page
- Products Page
- Product Information Page
- Reviews Page
- Login Page
- Register Page
- User Profile Page
- Admin Profile Page
- Add Category Page (Admin Only)
- Edit Category Page (Admin Only)
- Add Product Page (Admin Only)
- Edit Product Page (Admin Only)
- Manage Users Page (Admin Only)
- User Feedback Page (Admin Only)

The registered user CRUD functionality is all accessed through modal forms which include:
- Add Review Modal
- Edit Review Modal
- Contact Us Modal


### **_Wireframes Mockup_**
**Wireframes:**
- Desktop Wireframes can be viewed [here](wireframes/desktop)
- Tablet Wireframes can be viewed [here](wireframes/tablet)
- Mobile Wireframes can be viewed [here](wireframes/mobile)

- The wireframe design didn't really deviate from the original concept, except for the addition of further CRUD functionality, and a few extra features such as a contact modal, and including the user favourites on the profile page instead of a separate page for products favourited by users. Also I did not get to implement the use of a user profile image at this point in the project. It has always been the plan to include plenty of images, with minimal text, and provide a user friendly, fun and inviting website.


### **_Surface Plane_**
#### **_Colours_**
- The colour palette chosen for this project is bright, fun, and vibrant. After doing some research into similar sites, I found that many makeup product sites are very similar in design, using white background and black text, however I wanted my website to stand out amongst the crowd, and decided to use pink, turquoise and yellow as the theme. Makeup is about expressing yourself, and allows people to be creative and fun when using products, also bright colours are extremely popular in makeup products at the moment. 
- I wanted people to be visually attracted to the website, and wanted to pique the interest of the user, so they would be encouraged to join and create content. Today, people have to visit a variety of instagram accounts to get access to product reviews, with each influencer promoting a different product, but sometimes it can be hard to trust those reviews, as many influencers get paid to review makeup products. I wanted to create a space for the everyday makeup lover, a place they could go to express their real honest views on makeup products, and allow them to keep a record of these items all in one space. 
- The main background I have kept white, for the purpose of not overshadowing the images. The card layout and accordions are a variety of turquoise with pink text, or pink with turquoise text. Yellow is used for the ratings, call to action buttons/or button text. I have keep the body of content such as review content and product descriptions black, purely to make the content easy to read, and clear, for the user.


#### **_Typography_**
- The fonts chosen for this project were 'Dancing Script' for the logo and headers, as it has a nice design, a creative feel, and is visually attractive. The body of the website uses the font 'Lato' as it reads well, and doesn't distract from the actual content of the site, while still visually appealing. 


#### **_Images_**
The images for this site were sourced from a variety of locations:
- The homepage background image was sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/colored-powders-and-brush-1749452/)

### **Acknowledgements**
This project was a new challenge for me as it was my first project working with databases, and also the first project that contained multiple pages. In undertaking this challenge, I have learned so much, which will be of great benefit to me going forward into future projects. In hindsight, there are some elements throughout this process that I would handle differently in future projects, but given my timeframe, and skills to date, I am very happy with the project what I have achieved. I have been amazed at how far I have come in the last year. I would like to thank tutor support, special mention to Tim, for the amazing support, and advice I was given, when dealing with one or two issues in this project. I found the tutor support experience really rewarding, as I came away having learned some valuable information, that will stick with me for future projects. The tutor support team are extremely patient, helpful, and understanding, and it is a extremely valuable resource to have available to me.
I would also like to thank my mentor Brian Macaria, for his support, encouragement, and guidance and help throughout this project.
I would also like to thank Code Institute, for giving me the opportunity to participate in this course, I have finally found something I have a real interest in, and I am enjoying every aspect, both challenges and victories.

## **_Milestone Project 3 - Data Centric Development_**

## **Project Description**
This project is a makeup review website developed with the purpose of providing real, honest and authentic reviews on makeup products. It allows users to add, edit and delete their own content. The makeup industry has grown exponentially over the last decade and with it a vast amount of products to chose from and a growing number of sites to purchase from. Makeup is an art, it provides a way for people to express themselves. With the growth of influencers, the idea of trustworthy reviews has become an issue in mainstream society as the people promoting these products have a lot to gain from the results of pushing product sales. With this in mind I decided to develop a review site that allows everyday users to add their opinion on products and also see reviews left by other users on products they are looking to try out. The user can then add products to their favourites which is a list of products the user wants to buy. The inspiration for this project came from the fact I am always on the hunt for good makeup products to buy but it can be so easy to get lost in the sea of information and false advertising and it's difficult to trust reviews you see on Instagram or on sites where they are selling these products. This site acts as a sort of makeup forum with the hope of providing a tips and tricks section or makeup tutorials section in the future and a means by which users can connect with each other through the platform.

## **UX**
This website was designed for makeup lovers who are looking for honest product reviews from everyday makeup users with the end goal of identifying the products they like and are worth purchasing. The design of this website is fun and inviting with use of vivid imagery and a bold and vibrant colour palette. The idea is to to create a reliable review platform for users and encourage users to want to sign up and create content and express their honest opinions on products. It is a user friendly, and easy to navigate with clear calls to action.

### **_User Stories_**

### **_Strategy Plane_**
- The aim of this project was to develop a makeup review website, that provides honest real reviews on makeup products generated from everyday users from real life experience using the products. The website is vibrant, energetic, fun, inviting and easy to navigate. 
- This website was designed with a focus on user experience and user needs and the aim of encouraging users to join and create content. With this in mind I made the decision to include pre-populated products, for an easier user experience. A lot of information would need to be sourced to add a product which might be discouraging to users when adding content to the site. It is designed so only admin can add/edit products and users can add reviews to the products and edit and delete these from their profile. - I have also included a user feedback modal so that users can communicate with admin on suggested products to add to the site, or provide feedback on site improvements. These feedback comments can then be seen by admin in the user feedback section on the admin profile and deleted as necessary. 
- This project should be a go to for users when researching the best makeup products worth purchasing. There are so many makeup product websites and blogs, it is hard to distinguish between them so the aim of this project was to provide a more interactive and enjoyable way of experiencing this type of website.


### **_Scope Plane_**
- The priority for this project was to create a database of popular user products available on the market and allow users to create, edit and delete reviews for these products and have access to other user reviews. 
- It was extremely important that the site’s purpose was immediately evident and that it was fun and attractive to users. It needed to be vibrant with a clear layout and easy to use navigation. 
- Given my timeframe and skills, my focus was on ensuring that users had control their own content they created for the website, to provide a profile where this content could be accessed together and to provide as many benefits to the user as possible. 
- I decided to pre-populate the products and product information for the site for ease of use while also providing a means of communication between admin and users so that users get to have more involvement in the content creation and improvements for the site. This would allow the Admin team to keep track of areas for improvement and really deliver the content that the user was looking for.
- The site needed to be easy to use so it was necessary to include search bars on the homepage, products page and product information pages. I want to ensure that the user could search by product name, brand or category name. This would allow the user to navigate to different items with ease while also have the navigation bar menu displayed at all times if they wish to navigate to the homepage, profile, sign out or login and category pages.
- The products page contains a list of products depending on item searched or category chosen. Each product shows the user the average reviews and also the number of reviews for each product, which acts as a like to that product’s reviews. Also included is a button ‘More Info’ that allows the user to navigate to further information and reviews on that specific product.
- The use of vivid images and minimal text on the category and products pages was so that the user isn’t overwhelmed with information, but has the option to delve deeper into a specific product if they wish where they have the option to see product reviews, add a review or delete a review they have added. The product information shows a limit of 5 reviews under each product, however there is a ‘More Reviews’ button located underneath to take the user to all the product reviews for that specific item. 
- To make navigation easy for the user on the reviews page I have provided a button that brings the user back to the product information of that specific item.
- It was also essential that user could create a list of favourite products and have the ability to add and remove these products whenever they wished to do so. I have included favourite buttons on each product and product information page that immediately indicate to the user if the product has been added to this list or not with the use of a heart icon which toggles from outlined to full colour depending on whether the product is in the user favourites list.
- The user profile welcomes the user with a visual greeting on sign in and included an accordion list of their favourite products, a button for leaving feedback comments, the reviews they have created and a button to delete their account if necessary.
- The admin profile contains a different layout showing an accordion menu with management items such as all reviews with the ability to delete these, all users with the ability to delete a user account, user feedback with the ability to delete comments and adding, editing products and categories for the site.
- Along with this, I wanted the site to be accessible to all but with extra features/benefits to registered users. The products and reviews can be seen and accessed by everyone who visits the site, however only registered users can add reviews and add their favourites products.


### **_Structure Plane_**
- The structure of this website was designed to be easy to navigate and user friendly. The navigation bar is visible on every page and includes different links depending on whether a user is logged in, a guest user or the admin user. It is a vibrant, fun and inviting site, using vivid images and a bright colour scheme designed to capture the attention and peak the interest of the user. 
- The homepagehas a simple and straightforward design with a bright full viewgeight background image and a jumbotron with minimal text that states the purpose of the website. A search bar and two call to action buttons, 'Register' and 'Sign In' are also included to encouage the user to create an account.
The navigation bar includes a dropdown menu of product category groups that take the user to a list of product categories within that group. These are designed using cards with a top image and the product category underneath with a search icon. This will lead the user to the products within the specific category. Minimal text is used here so as not to overload the user with information.
- The products page is designed in a similar layout using card structure with product images and a card with basic product information, including name, brand, average rating, number of reviews, price and number of shades that are available. It also has a heart icon available to registered users which will add or remove a product from the user favourites list. It also contains a button 'More Info' that will lead the user to more in depth information on the specific product. 
- The product information page is a card layout with product image and product information which includes product name, brand, description, price, average rating and shades available. It also has a heart icon available to registered users which will add or remove a product from the user favourites list. A button to add a review is available to registered users and the most recent 5 reviews for that product are shown in card layout below the product card. At the bottom of the page under the most recent reviews is another button which leads the user to the remaining reviews for this product.
- Both the products page and the product information page have a search bar at the top to allow users to search for different products by product name, category or brand.
- The reviews page is a card layout displaying all reviews related to that specific product. Reviews contain a title, star rating, review, user who the review was added by, and the date it was created.
This page also contains a button that will bring the user back to the product information page of the related product. 
- The register and login pages can be accessed from the home page and the navigation bar. It is a basic form which includes fields, username, email and password for sign up and username and password for sign in. These pages also contain links to either page if the user is on the incorrect one.
- When users register they have a profile which can be accessed by the navigation bar once logged in.
This page includes a header with the users name, a list of their favourite products, a button to submit user feedback to admin through a modal and below this is a list of the reviews the user has created and a button to delete their account.
- All user functionality i.e adding and editing content is done through use of modal popups and buttons to delete items. The delete buttons have a sweetalert popup to confirm any deletes made on the site.
- The admin user has a slightly different layout on the profile page which consists of an accordion menu which allows them to access a list of all users, a list of all reviews, a list of all feedback, which gives the admin user the ability to delete any of these list items from the database. It also includes a manage button to allow the admin user to add, edit or delete a product or category.
- Guest users can view the categories page, products page, product info page, and reviews page, however all functionality is unabale to be accessed i.e. adding, editing or deleting reviews.
- Flash messages are used to alert the user when any action has been taken and are displayed at the top of the page. They are programmed to dropdown and timeout after a few seconds.


**Here is the site layout for this project:**

### **Database Architecture**
The database for this project was created using MongoDb. It consists of 5 collections: 
- Categories - stores the category name and category group
- Products - stores the product name, brand, category name, description, price, number of shades, image url, url link to where to purchase
- Reviews - stores the product id, review title, rating, review content, username who created the review and the date it was created
- Users - stores the username, email, password and an array of favourite products(product ids)
- User Feedback - stores the user id, name and comments
- The collections were structured as follows:


![Database Schema](static/images/database_schema_design.jpg "Database Collections")


### **_Skeleton Plane_**
This project contains multiple pages, with some pages displaying different elements based on the level of user: Admin user, guest user and registered user. It incorporates CRUD functionality for registered users and admin users in a variety of different elements. It also includes delete confirmation popups to ensure nothing that the delete functionality is authorised by the user or admin user.
This project layout contains the following pages:
- Homepage
- Categories Page
- Products Page
- Product Information Page
- Reviews Page
- Login Page
- Register Page
- User Profile Page
- Admin Profile Page
- Add Category Page (Admin Only)
- Edit Category Page (Admin Only)
- Add Product Page (Admin Only)
- Edit Product Page (Admin Only)
- Manage Users Page (Admin Only)
- User Feedback Page (Admin Only)

The registered user CRUD functionality is all accessed through modal forms which include:
- Add Review Modal
- Edit Review Modal
- Contact Us Modal


### **_Wireframes Mockup_**
- [Wireframes]()
- The wireframe design didn't really deviate from the original except for a few extra features such as a contact modal, the exclusion of a user profile image and including the user favourites on the profile page instead of a separate page for products favourited by users. It has always been the plan to include plenty of images with minimal text and provide a user friendly, fun and inviting website.

## **Testing**
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
### **Tests Carried Out**
List each page and tests carried out within each
### **General**
Check alt text on images
Spellcheck on README
Autoprefixer CSS
Mobile Friendly Test
Testing on Physical devices
#### **User Story Tests**
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
### **Issues Encountered**
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### **Acknowledgements**
This project was a new challenge for me as it was my first project working with databases and also the first project that contained multiple pages. In undertaking this challenge I have learned so much which will be of great benefit to me going forward into future projects. In hindsight there are some elements throughout this process that I would handle differently in future projects, but given my timeframe and skills to date I am very happy with the project and I have been amazed at how far I have come in the last year. I would like to thank tutor support, special mention to Tim, for the amazing support and advice I was given when dealing with one or two issues in this project. I found the tutor support experience really rewarding as I came away having learned some valuable information that will stick with me for use in future projects. The tutor support team are extremely patient, helpful and understanding and it is a extremely valuable resource to have available to me.
I would also like to thank my mentor Brian Macaria for his support, encouragement and guidance throughout this project.
I would also like to thank Code Institute for giving me the opportunity to participate in this course, I have finally found something I have a real interest in and I am enjoying every aspect, both challenges and victories.

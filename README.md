## **_Milestone Project 3 - Data Centric Development_**

## **Project Description**
This project is a makeup review website developed with the purpose of providing real, honest and authentic reviews on makeup products. It allows users to add, edit and delete their own content. The makeup industry has grown exponentially over the last decade and with it a vast amount of products to chose from and a growing number of sites to purchase from. Makeup is an art, it provides a way for people to express themselves. With the growth of influencers, the idea of trustworthy reviews has become an issue in mainstream society as the people promoting these products have a lot to gain from the results of pushing product sales. With this in mind I decided to develop a review site that allows everyday users to add their opinion on products and also see reviews left by other users on products they are looking to try out. The user can then add products to their favourites which is a list of products the user wants to buy. The inspiration for this project came from the fact I am always on the hunt for good makeup products to buy but it can be so easy to get lost in the sea of information and false advertising and it's difficult to trust reviews you see on Instagram or on sites where they are selling these products. This site acts as a sort of makeup forum with the hope of providing a tips and tricks section or makeup tutorials section in the future and a means by which users can connect with each other through the platform.

### **_Business Objectives_**
- Create a community for makeup lovers that they can trust
- Provide users with up to date products and product information

- Help users to find the products they are looking for

### **_Customer Objectives_**
- To establish the purpose of the website immediately
- To easily navigate the website
- To be able to quickly search for the products they are looking for.
- A website that is attractive, inviting and interesting.
- To browse products and their reviews easily.
- To have the ability to create their own profile

- To have the ability to remove products from favourites list.
- To have the ability to edit and delete their own content

- To have access to product stockists


### **_Future Goals_**
- Provide users with links to where the product can be bought

## **UX**
UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
### **_User Stories_**
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## **Testing**
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
### **Tests Carried Out**
List each page and tests carried out within each
### **General**
Check alt text on images
Spellcheck on README
Autoprefixer CSS
Mobile Friendly Test
Testing on Physical devices
#### **User Story Tests**
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
### **Issues Encountered**
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
## **Deployment**
This project was developed using Gitpod IDE, then pushed to Github where the repository was stored.
It was then deployed automatically through Heroku from the Github respository.
### **Project Deployment**
##### **The following steps outline how the project was deployed to Heroku:**
Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
##### **To run the project locally:**
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

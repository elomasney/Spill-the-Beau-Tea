## **Testing**

### **Tests Carried Out**

### **Validation**
**HTML**
- I used the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- I tested all HTML pages by either url link or the 'view source code' link on Google DevTools
- When I first ran my code through the HTML validator, there were a few minor errors with buttons and anchor tags
- I resolved these minor issues and ran all page through the validator again.
- All HTML pages passed the validation

**CSS**

- All CSS code passed the validation process with no errors

**Javascript**

- When I ran the Javascript code through the validator all code passed with no errors

**Python**
